### Day 0: September 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I did exercises 2.6 to 2.10 on [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#exercises-2-11-2-14).

**Thoughts** I've started fullstackopen many days ago and thoroughly enjoying React developement. Also I've marked this day as day 0 as I have not calculated today's work as I got to know about 100daysofcode just now.
